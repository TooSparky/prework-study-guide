## Boot Camp Prework study guide for students

This is a prework study guide containing HTML, CSS, README, and JavaScript.
This guide is for practice, and to look back on for notes.

My motivation is to remember the code that I work on.
I built this project to have a solid example of different coding languages to remember.
This example code solves the problem of having no example to look at.
I learned how to type HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also learned how to type a README and how to upload to GitHub.
